# lean_os — Milestones

This file is the living progress record for the project. Update the status
and notes on a milestone as soon as it's reached — this is the source of
truth for "where are we" across sessions.

Status legend: `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done

## Ground rules / assumptions

- **Architecture:** x86_64, UEFI boot only (the original legacy-BIOS boot
  path was removed in M26 - see below).
- **Bootloader:** written entirely from scratch (`kernel/boot/uefi/boot.c`,
  a hand-written PE32+ EFI application), no GRUB/Multiboot/Limine or any
  third-party boot code.
- **Language:** freestanding C for kernel/system_api/user_space, with x86_64
  assembly (NASM — decided in M0) for boot code, context switches, and other
  spots C can't reach. No libc, no newlib, no external libraries linked into
  any binary the OS ships. (Revisit if you'd rather use Rust/Zig instead of
  C — nothing below depends on the choice, only M3 onward's code does.)
  `<stdint.h>`/`<stddef.h>` are fine to `#include`: they're compiler-provided
  freestanding headers (type definitions and macros resolved at compile
  time), not part of any linked C library — nothing from them ends up
  linked into the binary. Kernel objects are also linked with `x86_64-elf-ld`
  directly (not via `gcc` as the link driver), so there's no libc/crt0 for
  a stray implicit link to pull in even by accident.
- **Toolchain (dev-time only, not shipped):** a cross-compiler targeting
  `x86_64-elf` (clang with `-target x86_64-elf` or a self-built
  `x86_64-elf-gcc`/binutils), `ld` for linking with custom linker scripts,
  and QEMU (`qemu-system-x86_64`) for fast iteration. These build/test the
  OS; none of their code ends up in the OS image. Real-hardware testing
  (USB boot) is a manual fallback once QEMU boots reliably.
- **Repo layout:**
  ```
  kernel/          # boot code, arch/x86_64, mm, sched, drivers, fs, kernel.c
  system_api/      # syscall ABI: numbers, structs, calling convention —
                   # shared contract between kernel and user_space
  user_space/      # crt0/runtime, init, shell, utilities
  tools/           # toolchain build scripts, qemu run/debug scripts
  docs/            # design notes per subsystem
  milestones.md    # this file
  ```
- **Build system:** plain Makefiles + hand-written linker scripts. No
  CMake/Meson/autotools, no package manager.

---

- [x] First C code runs (freestanding: `-ffreestanding -nostdlib`, no libc)
- [x] VGA text-mode driver for `kprintf`-style debug output
- [x] Panic handler (halt + message)

## M4 — CPU fundamentals in the kernel ✅

- [x] Kernel-owned GDT/TSS setup (bootloader's GDT was temporary)
- [x] IDT + interrupt/exception handlers (divide-by-zero, GPF, page fault,
      double fault at minimum)
- [x] PIC remap (or APIC if you want to skip legacy PIC)

## M5 — Memory management ✅

- [x] Physical frame allocator, seeded from the E820 map
- [x] Virtual memory manager (page table manipulation, map/unmap)
- [x] Kernel heap allocator (`kmalloc`/`kfree`)

## M6 — Timer & core drivers ✅

- [x] PIT or APIC timer, tick counter, `sleep`-style busy wait
- [x] Serial port (COM1) driver for debug logging (parallel to VGA)
- [x] PS/2 keyboard driver

## M7 — Multitasking basics ✅

- [x] Task/thread control block struct
- [x] Context switch (assembly) between kernel threads
- [x] Simple round-robin scheduler driven by the timer interrupt

## M8 — System call interface (`system_api/`) ✅

- [x] Define syscall ABI: numbering, register convention, `syscall`/`sysret`
      (or `int 0x80`) entry
- [x] `system_api/include/` headers shared by kernel and user_space
- [x] Kernel-side syscall dispatch table
- [x] First syscalls: `write`, `exit`, `getpid`

## M9 — User mode & process loading ✅

- [x] Ring 3 transition, TSS configured for privilege-level switches
- [x] Minimal ELF64 loader in the kernel
- [x] User stack + address space setup per process

## M10 — User-space runtime ✅

- [x] `user_space/lib` crt0 (`_start`) for user binaries
- [x] Thin syscall wrapper functions (built from `system_api/` headers)
- [x] Bare string/mem helpers (`memcpy`, `strlen`, ...) — hand-written, no
      external libc

## M11 — First user program end-to-end ✅

- [x] "Hello world" built against `user_space/lib` + `system_api`
- [x] Kernel loads and runs it, output visible via syscall `write`
- [x] This is the milestone that proves the whole stack (boot → kernel →
      syscall → user space) works together

## M12 — Storage & filesystem ✅

- [x] ATA (PIO mode) disk driver
- [x] Minimal custom filesystem format (or a simple FAT-like layout) + VFS
      layer in the kernel
- [x] Load user binaries from disk instead of an embedded/in-memory blob

## M14 — IPC & process management ✅

- [x] Pipes
- [x] Signals (basic set: kill, term, etc.)
- [x] Process groups / more complete `wait` semantics

## Path to a desktop environment (M15+)

Everything through M14 is text-mode only — no framebuffer, no pointing
device, no windowing, no user-space heap. This is the ordered path from
there to "boot into a graphical desktop and run my own custom apps,"
zero dependencies preserved throughout (BIOS VBE calls are dev-time boot
handoff, same category as the existing E820/disk-read BIOS calls — not a
runtime dependency).

## M15 — Filesystem headroom ✅

- [x] Current cap (`LEANFS_MAX_FILE_SIZE` = 16 direct blocks x 512 B = 8 KiB)
      is already tight: existing user ELFs are ~7 KiB. Raise it before
      anything bigger (fonts, a UI toolkit, GUI apps) needs to land on disk.
- [x] Add indirect blocks (or grow direct block count / block size) to
      leanfs; grow the data region accordingly
- [x] Re-verify M12/M13's persistence tests still pass at the new limits

## M16 — Linear framebuffer & graphics primitives ✅

- [x] Extend stage2 to set a VBE/VESA linear framebuffer mode (`INT 10h
      AX=4F02h`) and query mode info (`AX=4F01h`) for physical base/pitch/
      width/height/bpp before the protected-mode transition
- [x] Pass framebuffer info through the existing boot handoff struct
      (alongside the E820 pointer)
- [x] `kernel/drivers/fb.c`: map the framebuffer physical region, pixel
      plot / fill-rect / blit primitives
- [x] Retire VGA text mode as the primary display (keep serial/klog for
      debug logging either way) — deferred the actual text-mode retirement
      to M17 (framebuffer console), since VGA text is still the only
      logging surface until then; klog/serial are untouched either way

## M17 — Framebuffer text console + font rendering ✅

- [x] Embed a fixed-width bitmap font in the kernel image
- [x] Software glyph renderer + scrolling text console drawn over the
      framebuffer
- [x] Route existing klog output through it, so all prior boot logging
      stays visible without touching every call site again

## M18 — PS/2 mouse driver & cursor ✅

- [x] IRQ12 driver, 3-byte packet decode (dx/dy/buttons) — same shape as
      M6's keyboard driver
- [x] Cursor sprite draw/erase over the framebuffer (save/restore pixels
      underneath; no compositor yet to own this properly)

## M19 — User-space heap allocator & shared memory ✅

- [x] `SYS_sbrk`-style syscall to grow a process's address space on demand
- [x] `user_space/lib` malloc/free (mirrors the kernel heap's design) so
      apps can allocate dynamically — nothing in user space can today
- [x] A shared-memory syscall (compositor <-> app pixel buffers) — pipes
      are the wrong tool for whole-frame pixel data

## M20 — Windowing compositor ✅

- [x] User-space compositor process owns the framebuffer exclusively
- [x] IPC protocol for apps to create a window (request a shared pixel
      buffer), submit damage/redraw, and receive input events — damage/
      redraw and input receipt landed in a narrower form than originally
      scoped; see the progress log for exactly what and why
- [x] Compositor blits windows to the real framebuffer in z-order, draws
      borders/title bars — z-order exists structurally (a window list,
      painted in order) but is unproven beyond one window; see M21

## M21 — App UI toolkit + input routing ✅

- [x] `user_space/lib` drawing API (rects, lines, text) targeting an app's
      window buffer
- [x] Compositor routes keyboard/mouse events to the focused window;
      focus-follows-click
- [x] 1-2 demo GUI apps (clock, simple paint) proving the full pipeline
      end to end

## M22 — Desktop shell ✅

- [x] Taskbar/dock listing running apps, click to focus/minimize
- [x] App launcher reading the filesystem for available executables
- [x] This is the milestone where "desktop environment running custom
      apps" is genuinely true, not aspirational

## M23 — Desktop icon + GUI terminal ✅

- [x] `wm_create_request_t.desktop`: a chrome-less, full-screen, always-
      on-*bottom* window kind (compositor.c's mirror image of M22's
      panel) - the actual "desktop" background a real icon can be drawn
      on and double-clicked through gaps in other windows
- [x] `desktop_icons.c`: one double-click-to-launch "Terminal" icon on
      that background (`WM_EVENT_MOUSE_BUTTON` timestamp pair via
      `sys_uptime_ms`, no drag/select/rename - launching is the only
      interaction a single-icon desktop needs)
- [x] `SYS_dup2` + `SYS_wait_nb`: the two missing fd-table/process
      primitives a real in-window shell needs that no earlier milestone
      did - pointing a client's own stdout at a pipe before `SYS_spawn`
      so a *child's* output can be captured instead of hitting the global
      console, and polling a spawned child non-blockingly so a GUI event
      loop never stalls waiting for it
- [x] `gui_terminal.c`: a real line-editing shell in its own window
      (own text-grid renderer over `WM_EVENT_KEY`, not `user_space/shell`'s
      fd 0/1 console path) - runs the same coreutils the panel launcher
      already spawns, with their real stdout captured and rendered in
      the window instead of racing the compositor for the framebuffer
- [x] `init.c` now also spawns `desktop_icons` alongside the compositor
      and desktop shell, torn down and respawned together

## M24 — UEFI boot path ✅

- [x] `kernel/boot/uefi/{efi.h,efi_proto.h}`: hand-written UEFI base types
      and the handful of protocols needed (Simple Text Output, Boot
      Services, Loaded Image, Block I/O, Graphics Output) - no GNU-EFI or
      edk2 headers linked in, same "write it ourselves" ethos as
      everything else this project ships, just matching a public spec's
      ABI instead of a BIOS one
- [x] `kernel/boot/uefi/boot.c`: the UEFI counterpart to stage1+stage2 -
      GetMemoryMap → the exact e820_entry_t handoff format kernel/mm/
      e820.h already defines, GOP → the exact fb_boot_info_t format
      kernel/drivers/fb.h already defines, raw EFI_BLOCK_IO_PROTOCOL
      reads (not a filesystem) to fetch kernel.bin from the same fixed
      LBA stage2.asm reads it from, then ExitBootServices and a raw-asm
      jump into kernel_main with the identical RDI/RSI register handoff
      - producing byte-compatible structures is what let kernel.c/pmm.c/
      fb.c stay completely unmodified; this milestone is 100% new files
      plus a 16-byte partition-table patch to stage1.asm
- [x] `kernel/boot/stage1.asm`: the disk's boot sector is now also a
      valid legacy MBR (one partition entry, type 0xEF, sitting in the
      gap between the existing boot blob and leanfs's start) - UEFI reads
      that table and finds the ESP; BIOS still just runs the boot code
      above it and never looks at the table at all. One disk image, two
      independent boot paths, no GPT needed since the kernel is fetched
      by raw LBA rather than from inside the ESP's filesystem
- [x] Toolchain: `clang -target x86_64-unknown-windows` + `lld-link`
      (PE32+ output - a UEFI application has to be PE, not ELF) and
      `mtools` (formats the ESP directly inside the disk image via
      `mformat -i image@@byteoffset`, no loopback mount needed) - see
      docs/toolchain.md
- [x] `tools/build-ovmf.sh` + `tools/run-qemu-uefi.sh`: OVMF firmware
      built from source (tianocore/edk2, CLANGPDB toolchain) rather than
      installed, because the only prebuilt OVMF available on this
      machine (a 2021 build from a third-party tap) reliably crashes
      under current QEMU - a firmware bug with nothing to do with this
      project's own boot code, confirmed by reproducing it against a
      trivial "print a string" EFI app before writing any real logic
- [x] One real bug worth remembering: boot.c's own scratch pool
      allocations were originally tagged with a custom EFI_MEMORY_TYPE
      value in the UEFI spec's OS-reserved range (0x80000000+). That
      value doesn't fit EFI_MEMORY_TYPE's signed-int underlying
      representation, got sign-extended to garbage crossing the ms_abi
      call boundary into the firmware, and corrupted DxeCore's own state
      badly enough to crash *inside the firmware*, several calls later -
      diagnosed by rebuilding OVMF as a DEBUG build to get real PDB
      symbol attribution on the crash. Fixed by just using the always-
      spec-safe `EfiLoaderData` instead; there was never a real need for
      a custom type

## M25 — Package/build tooling for third-party user programs ✅

- [x] `tools/build-user-program.sh`: compiles a standalone third-party
      `.c` file against `user_space/lib` (crt0 + syscall_wrappers +
      str/malloc/gfx/font8x16/wmclient) with the exact flags this
      project's own programs build with, pulled live from the Makefile
      (`make print-USER_CFLAGS`/`print-USER_LIBOBJS` - a small new
      generic `print-%` target) rather than a second hardcoded copy that
      could drift
- [x] `tools/leanfs-put.c`: a *host* program (ordinary hosted C, built
      with the system `cc`, never runs as part of the OS) that
      duplicates kernel/fs/leanfs.c's on-disk structs and allocation
      logic byte-for-byte and writes a file straight into an
      already-built disk image's leanfs region - the missing host-side
      half of M12's filesystem, letting a third-party program get onto
      disk without a kernel rebuild at all. Verified both via the
      kernel's own boot self-tests passing and an independent
      byte-for-byte round-trip check (including the indirect-block path)
      written from scratch against the format, not reusing leanfs-put's
      own code
- [x] `make preseed`: found a real interaction the hard way - leanfs-put
      writing onto a disk image that's never booted claims the first
      free inode, and if that's inode 0 it shifts kernel.c's M22 boot
      self-test's hardcoded "launcher slot 0 is hello, the first file
      ever seeded" assumption right out from under it, panicking on the
      very next boot. `make preseed` writes every built-in program via
      leanfs-put itself, in seed order, before any third-party program
      is added - not part of `all` and changes no default behavior (the
      kernel's own first-boot seeding already skips anything already
      present), just makes the third-party workflow safe by construction
      instead of by instruction
- [x] `docs/third-party-programs.md`: the end-to-end workflow

## M26 — UEFI-only boot, BIOS path removed ✅

- [x] Deleted `kernel/boot/stage1.asm` and `stage2.asm`;
      `kernel/boot/uefi/boot.c` is now the only boot loader - it already
      did the whole job itself (M24), nothing in the kernel proper needed
      to change
- [x] `kernel/boot/mbr.asm`: LBA 0 is now pure partition-table data (no
      executable boot code) - UEFI firmware still needs it to find the ESP
      (same legacy-MBR-with-a-0xEF-entry trick M24 introduced), nothing
      ever executes this sector as code anymore
- [x] Kernel blob moved from LBA 9 to LBA 1 (no more stage1+stage2 gap to
      reserve); `boot.c`'s `KERNEL_START_LBA` updated to match
- [x] `tools/run-qemu.sh` now builds (`make all`) and boots (via OVMF) in
      one command, auto-building OVMF firmware on first run if
      `build/ovmf/` is missing; `tools/run-qemu-uefi.sh` removed (merged
      into `run-qemu.sh`); the `Makefile`'s `run-uefi` target removed
      alongside it
- [x] `tools/qemu-serial-test.sh` updated to boot via OVMF too (had been
      implicitly BIOS-only, which would no longer boot at all)
- [x] `docs/flow.md` rewritten to walk through the UEFI boot flow in place
      of the removed BIOS stage1/stage2 deep-dive

## M27 — Networking stack + NIC driver ✅

- [x] `kernel/drivers/pci.h/.c`: brute-force PCI config-space enumeration
      (bus/slot/function, port 0xCF8/0xCFC) - just enough to find a device
      by vendor/device ID, read its I/O-mapped BAR0, and enable bus
      mastering + I/O space. No bridge walking, capability lists, or
      memory-mapped BARs - one device (the NIC below) is all this kernel
      has ever needed to find.
- [x] `kernel/drivers/rtl8139.h/.c`: RTL8139 Fast Ethernet driver (QEMU's
      `-device rtl8139`) - chosen over e1000/virtio-net as the smallest
      real register interface of the three (one I/O BAR, a fixed 8K RX
      ring the NIC DMAs into directly, 4 fixed TX descriptor slots, no
      descriptor-ring bookkeeping). PCI interrupt line hooks into the
      existing PIC-based `irq_register_handler` infra (M6) unchanged - a
      legacy `pc`-machine NIC's routed IRQ is just another PIC line, SMP's
      LAPIC/IOAPIC bring-up notwithstanding. `kernel/mm/pmm.h/.c` gained
      `pmm_alloc_contiguous`/`pmm_free_contiguous` for the RX ring's
      physically-contiguous DMA buffer - the single-frame allocator alone
      can't promise that.
- [x] `kernel/net/{ethernet,arp,ip,icmp,net}.h/.c`: Ethernet II framing,
      RFC 826 ARP (request/reply, small fixed cache, opportunistic
      learning from any received ARP or IP packet), minimal IPv4 (no
      fragmentation, on-link-vs-gateway next-hop resolution, standard
      Internet checksum), and ICMP echo request/reply in both directions.
      Static IP config (10.0.2.15/10.0.2.2, matching QEMU usermode
      networking's fixed DHCP lease and gateway) rather than a DHCP client -
      out of scope for "driver + ARP + ICMP", and the only network this
      kernel actually boots on.
- [x] `tools/run-qemu.sh` / `tools/qemu-serial-test.sh`: both now attach
      `-netdev user -device rtl8139` - QEMU's built-in SLIRP NAT, no root/
      tap setup required.
- [x] Boot self-test (`kernel/kernel.c`, after the SMP self-test): sends a
      real ICMP echo request to the gateway and blocks on a matching reply
      arriving asynchronously via the RX IRQ handler - proves NIC TX/RX,
      PCI IRQ routing, ARP resolution, and ICMP matching all work against
      a real peer (SLIRP), not a kernel-side loopback stand-in. Verified
      passing twice in a row via `tools/qemu-serial-test.sh`.
- [x] `rtl8139_init`/`net_init` return 0 rather than panicking when no NIC
      is attached - the one driver in this kernel where "not present" had
      to become a real, non-fatal outcome rather than every other
      driver's "assume it's there" panic: an RTL8139 is a legacy chip
      real machines (the separate "port to real hardware" stretch goal,
      below) essentially never have, so a hard panic here would have
      blocked every real-hardware boot at this exact self-test. Degrades
      the same way the keyboard/mouse self-tests already do for present-
      but-unexercised hardware. Verified both ways: boots and pings the
      gateway with a NIC attached, boots cleanly through to init with none.

## M28 — Port to real hardware (USB boot test) [~]

Preparation and tooling are done and verified as far as anything without
a physical machine and USB port can go; the actual boot-on-real-hardware
step is a manual one - see [docs/real-hardware.md](docs/real-hardware.md)
for the full runbook. Leaving this `[~]` rather than `[x]` until that
manual step has actually been run and reported back.

- [x] Fixed a real bug this stretch goal's own premise would have hit
      immediately: `kernel/boot/uefi/boot.c`'s `find_whole_disk_block_io`
      picked "the first non-partition Block I/O handle" - correct by
      accident under QEMU (exactly one disk ever attached) but a coin
      flip on any real machine with more than one drive (an internal SSD
      plus the USB stick this is meant to boot from). Rewrote it to walk
      UEFI device paths instead: get the handle this app was actually
      loaded from (`EFI_LOADED_IMAGE_PROTOCOL.DeviceHandle`), find its
      device path, and match the *disk* by finding another handle whose
      path is exactly that path's prefix (everything but the trailing
      partition node) - the standard technique real UEFI OS loaders use,
      newly added `EFI_DEVICE_PATH_PROTOCOL` support in `efi_proto.h` to
      make possible. Verified in QEMU by attaching a second, decoy disk
      and confirming the kernel still boots from the real one - the exact
      scenario the old code would have gotten wrong, made reproducible
      without needing real multi-disk hardware to catch it.
- [x] `tools/write-usb.sh`: writes `build/os-image.bin` onto a real USB
      drive (macOS via `diskutil`/raw `dd`, Linux via `lsblk`/`dd`),
      refusing obviously-wrong targets (the system disk, non-removable
      media) and requiring a typed confirmation of the exact device path
      before doing anything destructive.
- [x] `docs/real-hardware.md`: the full runbook - firmware settings
      needed (Secure Boot off, UEFI not CSM/Legacy boot mode), what
      normal boot output looks like, and which self-tests are *expected*
      to report "not found" on real hardware rather than indicating a
      real failure.
- [ ] The actual manual step: write the image to a drive, boot a real
      x86_64 UEFI machine from it, and confirm the framebuffer console
      comes up and boot self-tests run to completion (network/PS2 caveats
      in the runbook notwithstanding).

## Stretch goals (unordered, orthogonal to the desktop path)

- [x] SMP (multi-core) support
- [x] UEFI boot path as an alternative to BIOS (M24, above; BIOS itself
      later removed in M26, leaving UEFI as the only path)
- [x] Package/build tooling for third-party user programs (M25, above)
- [x] Networking stack + NIC driver (M27, above)
- [~] Port to real hardware (USB boot test) - prep/tooling/runbook done
      (M28, above); the manual boot-on-real-hardware step itself isn't yet
