# lean_os — Milestones

This file is the living progress record for the project. Update the status
and notes on a milestone as soon as it's reached — this is the source of
truth for "where are we" across sessions.

## Ground rules / assumptions

- **Architecture:** x86_64, legacy BIOS boot (not UEFI).
- **Bootloader:** written entirely from scratch (MBR stage 1 → stage 2 →
  long mode), no GRUB/Multiboot/Limine or any third-party boot code.
- **Language:** freestanding C for kernel/system_api/user_space, with x86_64
  assembly (NASM — decided in M0) for boot code, context switches, and other
  spots C can't reach. No libc, no newlib, no external libraries linked into
  any binary the OS ships. (Revisit if you'd rather use Rust/Zig instead of
  C — nothing below depends on the choice, only M3 onward's code does.)
  `<stdint.h>`/`<stddef.h>` are fine to `#include`: they're compiler-provided
  freestanding headers (type definitions and macros resolved at compile
  time), not part of any linked C library — nothing from them ends up
  linked into the binary. Kernel objects are also linked with `x86_64-elf-ld`
  directly (not via `gcc` as the link driver), so there's no libc/crt0 for
  a stray implicit link to pull in even by accident.
- **Toolchain (dev-time only, not shipped):** a cross-compiler targeting
  `x86_64-elf` (clang with `-target x86_64-elf` or a self-built
  `x86_64-elf-gcc`/binutils), `ld` for linking with custom linker scripts,
  and QEMU (`qemu-system-x86_64`) for fast iteration. These build/test the
  OS; none of their code ends up in the OS image. Real-hardware testing
  (USB boot) is a manual fallback once QEMU boots reliably.
- **Repo layout:**
  ```
  kernel/          # boot code, arch/x86_64, mm, sched, drivers, fs, kernel.c
  system_api/      # syscall ABI: numbers, structs, calling convention —
                   # shared contract between kernel and user_space
  user_space/      # crt0/runtime, init, shell, utilities
  tools/           # toolchain build scripts, qemu run/debug scripts
  docs/            # design notes per subsystem
  milestones.md    # this file
  ```
- **Build system:** plain Makefiles + hand-written linker scripts. No
  CMake/Meson/autotools, no package manager.

- [x] Enable the A20 line
- [x] Build and load a minimal GDT, enter 32-bit protected mode

      kernel
- [x] Set up identity-mapped paging structures, enable long mode (64-bit)
- [x] Jump into the kernel's entry point with a defined handoff (memory
      map pointer, etc.)

## M3 — Minimal freestanding kernel ✅

- [x] First C code runs (freestanding: `-ffreestanding -nostdlib`, no libc)
- [x] VGA text-mode driver for `kprintf`-style debug output
- [x] Panic handler (halt + message)

## M4 — CPU fundamentals in the kernel ✅

- [x] Kernel-owned GDT/TSS setup (bootloader's GDT was temporary)
- [x] IDT + interrupt/exception handlers (divide-by-zero, GPF, page fault,
      double fault at minimum)
- [x] PIC remap (or APIC if you want to skip legacy PIC)

## M5 — Memory management ✅

- [x] Physical frame allocator, seeded from the E820 map
- [x] Virtual memory manager (page table manipulation, map/unmap)
- [x] Kernel heap allocator (`kmalloc`/`kfree`)

## M6 — Timer & core drivers ✅

- [x] PIT or APIC timer, tick counter, `sleep`-style busy wait
- [x] Serial port (COM1) driver for debug logging (parallel to VGA)
- [x] PS/2 keyboard driver

## M7 — Multitasking basics ✅

- [x] Task/thread control block struct
- [x] Context switch (assembly) between kernel threads
- [x] Simple round-robin scheduler driven by the timer interrupt

## M8 — System call interface (`system_api/`) ✅

- [x] Define syscall ABI: numbering, register convention, `syscall`/`sysret`
      (or `int 0x80`) entry
- [x] `system_api/include/` headers shared by kernel and user_space
- [x] Kernel-side syscall dispatch table
- [x] First syscalls: `write`, `exit`, `getpid`

- [x] Minimal ELF64 loader in the kernel
- [x] User stack + address space setup per process

## M10 — User-space runtime ✅

- [x] `user_space/lib` crt0 (`_start`) for user binaries
- [x] Thin syscall wrapper functions (built from `system_api/` headers)
- [x] Bare string/mem helpers (`memcpy`, `strlen`, ...) — hand-written, no
      external libc

## M11 — First user program end-to-end ✅

- [x] "Hello world" built against `user_space/lib` + `system_api`
- [x] Kernel loads and runs it, output visible via syscall `write`
- [x] This is the milestone that proves the whole stack (boot → kernel →
      syscall → user space) works together

## M12 — Storage & filesystem ✅

- [x] ATA (PIO mode) disk driver
- [x] Minimal custom filesystem format (or a simple FAT-like layout) + VFS
      layer in the kernel

- [x] Pipes
- [x] Signals (basic set: kill, term, etc.)
- [x] Process groups / more complete `wait` semantics

## Path to a desktop environment (M15+)

Everything through M14 is text-mode only — no framebuffer, no pointing
device, no windowing, no user-space heap. This is the ordered path from
there to "boot into a graphical desktop and run my own custom apps,"
zero dependencies preserved throughout (BIOS VBE calls are dev-time boot
handoff, same category as the existing E820/disk-read BIOS calls — not a
runtime dependency).

## M15 — Filesystem headroom ✅

- [x] Current cap (`LEANFS_MAX_FILE_SIZE` = 16 direct blocks x 512 B = 8 KiB)
      is already tight: existing user ELFs are ~7 KiB. Raise it before
      anything bigger (fonts, a UI toolkit, GUI apps) needs to land on disk.
- [x] Add indirect blocks (or grow direct block count / block size) to
      leanfs; grow the data region accordingly
- [x] Re-verify M12/M13's persistence tests still pass at the new limits

## M16 — Linear framebuffer & graphics primitives ✅

- [x] Extend stage2 to set a VBE/VESA linear framebuffer mode (`INT 10h
      AX=4F02h`) and query mode info (`AX=4F01h`) for physical base/pitch/
      width/height/bpp before the protected-mode transition
- [x] Pass framebuffer info through the existing boot handoff struct
      (alongside the E820 pointer)
- [x] `kernel/drivers/fb.c`: map the framebuffer physical region, pixel
      plot / fill-rect / blit primitives
- [x] Retire VGA text mode as the primary display (keep serial/klog for
      debug logging either way) — deferred the actual text-mode retirement
      to M17 (framebuffer console), since VGA text is still the only
      logging surface until then; klog/serial are untouched either way

## M17 — Framebuffer text console + font rendering ✅

- [x] Embed a fixed-width bitmap font in the kernel image
- [x] Software glyph renderer + scrolling text console drawn over the
      framebuffer
- [x] Route existing klog output through it, so all prior boot logging
      stays visible without touching every call site again

## M18 — PS/2 mouse driver & cursor ✅

- [x] IRQ12 driver, 3-byte packet decode (dx/dy/buttons) — same shape as
      M6's keyboard driver
- [x] Cursor sprite draw/erase over the framebuffer (save/restore pixels
      underneath; no compositor yet to own this properly)

## M19 — User-space heap allocator & shared memory ✅

- [x] `SYS_sbrk`-style syscall to grow a process's address space on demand
- [x] `user_space/lib` malloc/free (mirrors the kernel heap's design) so
      apps can allocate dynamically — nothing in user space can today
- [x] A shared-memory syscall (compositor <-> app pixel buffers) — pipes
      are the wrong tool for whole-frame pixel data

## M20 — Windowing compositor ✅

- [x] User-space compositor process owns the framebuffer exclusively
- [x] IPC protocol for apps to create a window (request a shared pixel
      buffer), submit damage/redraw, and receive input events — damage/
      redraw and input receipt landed in a narrower form than originally
      scoped; see the progress log for exactly what and why
- [x] Compositor blits windows to the real framebuffer in z-order, draws
      borders/title bars — z-order exists structurally (a window list,
      painted in order) but is unproven beyond one window; see M21

## M21 — App UI toolkit + input routing ✅

- [x] `user_space/lib` drawing API (rects, lines, text) targeting an app's
      window buffer
- [x] Compositor routes keyboard/mouse events to the focused window;
      focus-follows-click
- [x] 1-2 demo GUI apps (clock, simple paint) proving the full pipeline
      end to end

## M22 — Desktop shell ✅

- [x] Taskbar/dock listing running apps, click to focus/minimize
- [x] App launcher reading the filesystem for available executables
- [x] This is the milestone where "desktop environment running custom
      apps" is genuinely true, not aspirational

## M23 — Desktop icon + GUI terminal ✅

- [x] `wm_create_request_t.desktop`: a chrome-less, full-screen, always-
      on-*bottom* window kind (compositor.c's mirror image of M22's
      panel) - the actual "desktop" background a real icon can be drawn
      on and double-clicked through gaps in other windows
- [x] `desktop_icons.c`: one double-click-to-launch "Terminal" icon on
      that background (`WM_EVENT_MOUSE_BUTTON` timestamp pair via
      `sys_uptime_ms`, no drag/select/rename - launching is the only
      interaction a single-icon desktop needs)
- [x] `SYS_dup2` + `SYS_wait_nb`: the two missing fd-table/process
      primitives a real in-window shell needs that no earlier milestone
      did - pointing a client's own stdout at a pipe before `SYS_spawn`
      so a *child's* output can be captured instead of hitting the global
      console, and polling a spawned child non-blockingly so a GUI event
      loop never stalls waiting for it
- [x] `gui_terminal.c`: a real line-editing shell in its own window
      (own text-grid renderer over `WM_EVENT_KEY`, not `user_space/shell`'s
      fd 0/1 console path) - runs the same coreutils the panel launcher
      already spawns, with their real stdout captured and rendered in
      the window instead of racing the compositor for the framebuffer
- [x] `init.c` now also spawns `desktop_icons` alongside the compositor
      and desktop shell, torn down and respawned together

## M24 — UEFI boot path ✅

- [x] `kernel/boot/uefi/{efi.h,efi_proto.h}`: hand-written UEFI base types
      and the handful of protocols needed (Simple Text Output, Boot
      Services, Loaded Image, Block I/O, Graphics Output) - no GNU-EFI or
      edk2 headers linked in, same "write it ourselves" ethos as
      everything else this project ships, just matching a public spec's
      ABI instead of a BIOS one
- [x] `kernel/boot/uefi/boot.c`: the UEFI counterpart to stage1+stage2 -
      GetMemoryMap → the exact e820_entry_t handoff format kernel/mm/
      e820.h already defines, GOP → the exact fb_boot_info_t format
      kernel/drivers/fb.h already defines, raw EFI_BLOCK_IO_PROTOCOL
      reads (not a filesystem) to fetch kernel.bin from the same fixed
      LBA stage2.asm reads it from, then ExitBootServices and a raw-asm
      jump into kernel_main with the identical RDI/RSI register handoff
      - producing byte-compatible structures is what let kernel.c/pmm.c/
      fb.c stay completely unmodified; this milestone is 100% new files
      plus a 16-byte partition-table patch to stage1.asm
- [x] `kernel/boot/stage1.asm`: the disk's boot sector is now also a
      valid legacy MBR (one partition entry, type 0xEF, sitting in the
      gap between the existing boot blob and leanfs's start) - UEFI reads
      that table and finds the ESP; BIOS still just runs the boot code
      above it and never looks at the table at all. One disk image, two
      independent boot paths, no GPT needed since the kernel is fetched
      by raw LBA rather than from inside the ESP's filesystem
- [x] Toolchain: `clang -target x86_64-unknown-windows` + `lld-link`
      (PE32+ output - a UEFI application has to be PE, not ELF) and
      `mtools` (formats the ESP directly inside the disk image via
      `mformat -i image@@byteoffset`, no loopback mount needed) - see
      docs/toolchain.md
- [x] `tools/build-ovmf.sh` + `tools/run-qemu-uefi.sh`: OVMF firmware
      built from source (tianocore/edk2, CLANGPDB toolchain) rather than
      installed, because the only prebuilt OVMF available on this
      machine (a 2021 build from a third-party tap) reliably crashes
      under current QEMU - a firmware bug with nothing to do with this
      project's own boot code, confirmed by reproducing it against a
      trivial "print a string" EFI app before writing any real logic
- [x] One real bug worth remembering: boot.c's own scratch pool
      allocations were originally tagged with a custom EFI_MEMORY_TYPE
      value in the UEFI spec's OS-reserved range (0x80000000+). That
      value doesn't fit EFI_MEMORY_TYPE's signed-int underlying
      representation, got sign-extended to garbage crossing the ms_abi
      call boundary into the firmware, and corrupted DxeCore's own state
      badly enough to crash *inside the firmware*, several calls later -
      diagnosed by rebuilding OVMF as a DEBUG build to get real PDB
      symbol attribution on the crash. Fixed by just using the always-
      spec-safe `EfiLoaderData` instead; there was never a real need for
      a custom type

## Stretch goals (unordered, orthogonal to the desktop path)

- [x] SMP (multi-core) support
- [x] UEFI boot path as an alternative to BIOS (M24, above)
- [ ] Networking stack + NIC driver
- [ ] Port to real hardware (USB boot test)
- [ ] Package/build tooling for third-party user programs (still built from
      scratch, just easier to author)
